# spring-webflux-streaming
This is a basic Spring WebFlux application which defines a streaming endpoint. We have defined a REST endpoint here as "/streaming". This is a GET endpoint so when we will hit this in the browser, we will get the continuous output as the sequential number infinitely.

### Compile the application
mvn clean compile

### Run the test cases
mvn clean test

### Run the application
mvn spring-boot:run

## REST Endpoint
| GET | http:localhost:8080/streaming |
| --- | --- |
